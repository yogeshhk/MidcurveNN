The paper addresses an interesting topic, and the survey of prior work as well as the problem definition is clearly presented.
However, the overall contribution remains at an early conceptual stage, and the level of completeness is insufficient.
Key areas for improvement include:
1. The experimental section is limited, and quantitative evaluation is lacking. 
2. There is insufficient implementation and validation to demonstrate that the proposed method works in practice. 
3. Several presentation issues need to be corrected, such as figure caption errors, reference errors, and placeholders (e.g., “??”).
Overall, the direction of the work is promising, but the current version lacks the experimental evidence and methodological completeness required for acceptance. We hope the authors will further strengthen the work through additional experiments and refinements.

The format of the paper is incomplete.
I can't even check the references.

This paper investigates the feasibility of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for geometric dimension reduction, specifically computing midcurves (1D representations) from 2D planar shapes. The author frames midcurve extraction as a graph summarization / text-to-text transformation problem, drawing analogies with machine translation and document summarization. Preliminary experiments using prompt-based LLM inference and fine-tuning CodeT5 are presented: GPT-4 performs reasonably on simple shapes, while most models fail on more complex topologies. The paper concludes that LLM-based approaches are promising but require further research.

While the idea of using LLMs is novel, the paper does not yet introduce a concrete algorithmic or architectural contribution. Most of the work remains exploratory or speculative. It is merely using LLM to solve the midcurve computation problem. Prompt-based experiments are interesting, but they are not a reliable scientific evaluation methodology.

Numerous missing citations (“[?]”), figures (“Fig. ??”), and placeholders reduce readability.
