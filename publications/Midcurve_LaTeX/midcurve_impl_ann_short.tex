% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Phase I}

% Image to Image Transformation Learning:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Img2Img: This phase focuses on learning image-to-image transformation using fixed-size $100 \times 100$ bitmaps.
% \item Data Augmentation: The training data will be augmented by scaling, rotating, and translating both input and output shapes within the fixed size.
% \item Network Architecture: An Encoder-Decoder network, specifically Semantic Segmentation or Pix2Pix, will be employed for image-based dimension reduction.
% \end{itemize}

% Original input and output are in the form of polylines, meaning a list of points, each having x,y coordinates

	% \begin{itemize}
	% \item For each shape, we have this pair of input and output. That's it. 
	% \item We need to start with these few samples only

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Augmentation}

	% \begin{itemize}
	% \item Such few profile shapes, are  just not enough for Neural Networks to train.
	% \item Need more with as much diversity as possible.
	% \item Will need to artificially augment data with transformations, like pan, rotate, mirror, etc.
	% \item All needs to be automatically, programmatically

	% \begin{itemize}

	% \item Converted it to fixed size $(100x100)$ image by rasterization of drawSVG library.

	% \begin{itemize}
	% \item Not very perfect but encouraging

	% \item Dimension Reduction is seen

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What can be done?}
	% \begin{itemize}
	% \item For the noise, use bounding boxes 
	% \item Feedback into error term: differencing with the known output expected 
	% \item Classify single pixel image as the skeleton, and rest as noise.

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What Next?}
	% \begin{itemize}
	% \item Add denoiser network after the current one
	% \item More Network Architectures
	% \item Sequence-to-Sequence based approaches, taking closed thin polygon as input and polyline as output
	% \item Extending to 3D, ie Midsurface
