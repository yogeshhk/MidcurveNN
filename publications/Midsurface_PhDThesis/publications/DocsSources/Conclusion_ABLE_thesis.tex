\section{Conclusions}

This chapter has proposed a new CAD model representation paradigm called $\mathcal{ABLE}$, to provide generalized definition of CAD features, as well as for application specific features like sheet metal features.  Using just a few entities such as Loft({\bf $\mathcal{L}$}), Booleans({\bf $\mathcal{B}$}) and Affine-transformations({\bf $\mathcal{A}$}) along with entities, a CAD model can be defined adequately. This chapter also presents how a feature based algorithm, e.g. the midsurface-computation, can be effectively devised using the generalized definitions provided by $\mathcal{ABLE}$. %The midsurface computation thus becomes portable to any CAD application which can represent and/or transform their native CAD model into $\mathcal{ABLE}$ model.
