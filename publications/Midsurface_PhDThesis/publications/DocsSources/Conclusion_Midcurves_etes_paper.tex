\section{Conclusion}

Skeletons generated by many widely researched methods like MAT, CAT, Straight Skeleton, do not represent the shape as per human perception, due to presence of gaps and unnecessary branches. For non-trivial shapes, instead of computing Midcurves on the whole shape, one can divide the shape in more manageable-simpler shapes for which Midcurves generation is far simpler problem. 

This paper presents such {\em divide-and-conquer} strategy. Polygons are decomposed into primitive sub-polygons, Midcurves are created for each of them and wherever necessary they are joined by extension.  The results of improved partitioning (over Bayazit's \cite{Bayazit} approach) and then its usage in creating better-connected Midcurves are shown.
