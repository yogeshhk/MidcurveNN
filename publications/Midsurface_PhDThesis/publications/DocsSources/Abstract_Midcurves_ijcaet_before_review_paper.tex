Applications like pattern recognition, shape matching, finite element analysis etc need a lower dimensional representation of higher dimensional shape.  Skeletons provide such one dimensional representation for 2D or 3D shapes. They can be computed for various types of inputs such as images, solids, sketches etc. Although there are  various methods available for computation of skeletons, their appropriateness depends on the requirement posed by their applications. Some focus on exact computation, some are approximate, some aim at faithful backward-reconstruction whereas some at proper representation for human perception etc.

This paper focuses on a method for creation of skeletons, called 'Midcurves', (the skeletons that are at the midway of a 2D shape) for planar polygon. This method based on the Divide-and-Conquer strategy and works in two phases - Decomposition and Midcurves generation. Towards end of the paper some test-case results are presented along with the conclusions.
