Defeatring,Feature based Sheet metal CAD model,Principal Shape feature CAD model,Autodesk Inventor VB.Net APIs,1863,Removes sheetmetal features and remnant features and computes dormant bodies,Not all sheet metal features; feature size is by area method; parent child suppression,For now suppresses the features but can delete them altoegther
Abstraction,Defeatured feature-based CAD model,Cells with ABEL feature owners,Autodesk Inventor VB.Net APIs,1506,Face Bend Flange ContourFlange Hem Loft Cut Hole,Loft between two thin profiles; Consumed flange portion parameters; tool body transofrms for group features; Fold Stamp Draw ,Most used features are working reasonably fine. At some places manual recreation is needed
Midcurves,Polygon point coordinates,Polyline points of the generated Midcurves ,C#.Net,4457,Midcurve of a facetted thin polygon by divide-and-conquer,Specifying internal holes; Input must be error free,English alphabet shapes and cases from past papers work well
Midsurface,Solid cells with ABEL feature owner,midsurface patch,Autodesk Inventor VB.Net APIs,1594,Either midcurve is swept or offset is used,Multiple surfaces; one per segment,No face pairing is needed
Joining,Cellular graph with ABEL feature owners,Well conncted midsurafce,Autodesk Inventor VB.Net APIs,634,iCells connect midsurface patches incident on them,Surface stitching; dormant body piercing,Midsurface is just visually shown and not persisted
Utilities,,,Autodesk Inventor VB.Net APIs,709,,,Commonly used geometric topological feature based functions
