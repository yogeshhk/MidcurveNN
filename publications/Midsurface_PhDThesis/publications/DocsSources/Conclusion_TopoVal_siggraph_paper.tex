\section{Conclusion}
This paper proposes a new way of topological validation of the Midsurface, computed from Sheet Metal parts. Validation attempts are done from both the directions, solid to its Midsurface and Midsurface to its corresponding solid. Examples show that the newly presented Sheet Metal Midsurface ( $\chi_{smm}$) Characteristic validates the Midsurface, ensuring that the thickened Solid would be a valid one as well.
