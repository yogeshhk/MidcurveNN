\section{Conclusion}

This paper proposes a new representation, using Spatial Grammars notations, called {\bf $\mathcal{ABLE}$}, to provide concise definitions of form features, and application specific features like Sheet Metal features. It shows how a generic feature, like {\em Loft}, can be manifested into variety of form features. Using just a few operations, like {\em Loft}({\bf $\mathcal{L}$}), {\em Booleans}({\bf $\mathcal{B}$}) and {\em Affine Transformations}({\bf $\mathcal{A}$}) along with entities, a CAD model can be built. It also presents how a feature based algorithm, e.g. the Midsurface Extraction algorithm, can be effectively devised using the neutral definitions provided by {\bf $\mathcal{ABLE}$}. This algorithm thus becomes portable to any CAD application which can provide feature-entities representations in {\bf $\mathcal{ABLE}$} format.
