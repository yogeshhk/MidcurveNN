\section{Conclusion}
This work proposes a new way of topological validation of the midsurface, computed from sheet metal parts. Validation attempts are performed from both the directions, solid to its midsurface and midsurface to its corresponding solid. The examples show that the newly-derived formulation works not only for simple shapes but also for the relatively-complex practical part.
