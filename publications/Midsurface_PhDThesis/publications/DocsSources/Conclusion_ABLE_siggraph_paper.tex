\section{Conclusion}

Spatial Grammars are used to represent shapes and have been widely used in exploratory-generative design processes, especially for Architectural domain. This paper proposes a novel way of using them for a concise and expressive definition of {\em form features}, called {\bf $\mathcal{ABLE}$}. This representation is able to express most of the {\em form features} with just few operators, like {\em Loft}({\bf $\mathcal{L}$}), {\em Booleans}({\bf $\mathcal{B}$}) and {\em Affine Transformations}({\bf $\mathcal{A}$}). {\bf $\mathcal{ABLE}$} will help not only in education, interoperability but also in developing portable application specific algorithms. This ability was demonstrated by developing a Midsurface operator used in CAE analysis.
