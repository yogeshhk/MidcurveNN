Automatic Preparation Of Cad-Generated Solid Geometry For Fe Meshing,Rol; Stolt; S Sunnersjo,2005,Features,DeFeat DimRedn,PreDef,Gen,Updatable Parameterized model is used to idealize CAD model. Proposes Idealize as model is created. Advantages (1. idealization could be accessed at all the time at any stages for FEA; 2. Idealized geometry will get updated as model changes due to parametric definition; 3. Designer can verify can correct the model at the designing stages itself. Assumptions (ALL geom is thin-wall with constant thickness; only one tooling draft direction allowed),"Talks about 2 sketch based features; PAD and POCKET; which sketches containing only lines and arcs. Details of how sketch needs to be extracted; how to treat multiple features; pockets/hole has been hinted nicely.  Thin re-
gions are found by paring sketch segments of “Pad” or “Pocket”
features. This approach takes cases involving removal of mate-
rial into account by combining sketches of additive and subtract-
tive features.","Limitations on types of features; sketch geometries.
Sketches need to be in plane perpendicular to draft direction.  due to interacting additive features; locally identi?ed thin regions may be not thin in the whole model;
which is not considered in this approach."

Reusing Cad Models For Die-Casting Products For Fea,Rol; Stolt,2006,Features,DeFeat DimRedn,PreDef,Cast," Author has shown how to use construction history tree of the solid CAD model to automatically identify these standardized features and to insert surfaces of the correct shape; size and orientation to represent the corresponding solid features.
Die-cast and moulded geometries often consist of mixed geometries. 3 ways moulded parts can be idealized (ALL Solids - bad for representation/compute time; Mixed - Shell for thin and Solid for thick portions; ALL Shells - lighter and can be used if mass and stiffness can be represented well.  In case of domain specific features; presents UI for manual guidance for feature detection.","States gap: ""all surfaces need to be trimmed against each other to form a complete connected surface representation; this is problematic as it has not been possible to formulate a theory that can deal with all types of connections between the individual surface patches. They have to be treated as individual cases; making it hard to guarantee success in every possible case"". ",Compares midsurface implementations by Hypermesh and Ansys. If surfaces are non-parallel or pairs are dissimilar; results are not good. Subsequent trimming time was too much (better to create midsurface from scratch.

Determining the Skeleton of a Simple Polygon in (Almost) Linear Time,Robert Edwards,2010,Curves,DimRedn,Skel,,"For convex polygons the method begins by creating a  double-linked list of rays that are bisectors of each angle. For each ray; distances are determined from a ray's  origin (a corner of the polygon) to the intersection with its predecessor ray and with its successor ray. 7  These  distances for a ray are called the behind and ahead intersection distances. The reduction then starts with each ray 
pair such that the ray to the rear has a behind distance greater than its ahead distance; and the ray to the fore has  a behind distance less than its ahead distance.",Almost linear time execution,Gaps at the ends
