Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisors Dr. Anil Sahasrabudhe and Dr. Mukund Kale for the continuous support of my Ph.D study and related research, for their patience, motivation, and immense knowledge. Their guidance helped me during research and at the time of writing of this thesis. I could not have imagined having better advisors and mentors for my Ph.D study.

Besides my advisors, I would like to thank the rest of my thesis committee: Prof. Vipin Tripathi, Prof. Arati Mulay, and Dr. S. N. Sapali, for their insightful comments and encouragement.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank my family: my parents, my wife - Anjali, and my kids - Reeya \& Deeya, for supporting me throughout writing this thesis and my life in general.
