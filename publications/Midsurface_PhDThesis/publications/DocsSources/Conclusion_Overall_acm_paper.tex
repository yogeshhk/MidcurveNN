\section{Conclusion}

Computation of midsurface is one of the popular simplification techniques for CAE analysis of  thin-walled models. In-spite of good demand, current methods (especially the popular Midsurface Abstraction - MA) suffer from problems such as gaps, overlaps, not lying midway, improper connections, etc.  In MA, these failures are due to complexities of face-pair detection and interactions. In our approach uses feature simplification and abstraction to resolve face-pair detection problems and  cellular decomposition to develop a generic logic to address interaction problems amongst midsurface patches.

\textbf{Researcher}  &	\textbf{Method} &	 \textbf{Shortcomings}  &	 \textbf{Our Approach}\\ \midrule
\textbf{Chong et al.} \cite{Chong2004}  & 
Uses concave edge decomposition. Midcurves by collapsing edge pairs. If they form a loop, creates a midsurface patch & 
Hard-coded inequalities/values to detect edge-pairs. Connection logic is not generic and comprehensive &
A generic treatment for the computation of midcurves, midsurface patches and their connections
\\ \midrule
 \textbf{Boussuge et al.} \cite{Boussuge2014}  & 
 Generative decomposition. Recognizes Extrudes of each sub-volume. Creates midsurface patches in each and connects them together. &
 
 \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nosep,leftmargin=*]
\item No fillets/chamfers.
\item Only Additive cells.
\item Only Extrudes with Analytical surfaces
\item Expensive MAT to detect thin profiles
\item Works only on Parallel and Orthogonal connections.
\end{itemize}
&
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nosep,leftmargin=*]
\item No such restriction
\item Re-inserts -ve cells
\item Generic Sweep extend-able to Loft
\item Simple rules of size of profile/guide
\item Generic logic for any numbers/types of connections.
