  year = {2008},
  abstract = {Shell finite elements are widely used for the analysis of thin section
	objects such as sheet metal parts, automobile bodies and et al. due
	to their computational efficiency. Since many of input data for finite
	element analysis are given as solid models or triangulated surface
	models, one should extract midsurface information from these input
	data initially and then construct shell meshes on the extracted midsurfaces.
	In this paper, a method of generating shell elements on midsurfaces
	directly from input models has been proposed, in which midsurface
	generating process can be omitted. In order to construct shell meshes,
	the input models should be triangulated on surfaces first, and then
	tetrahedral elements are generated by using an advancing front method,
	and finally mid shell surfaces are obtained from tetrahedral meshes.
	Some examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
	method.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel technique for modeling a 3D non-manifold
	freeform model around a 3D reference model. In order to represent
	both the design abstractions and the incomplete topological information,
	first of all, a new non-manifold data structure is defined. Our data
	structure embodies the functional vitalities of both the boundary
	representation data structure and the complex-based data structure.
	Along with our data structure, a set of topological operators is
	defined to manipulate the entities in the data structure. Based on
	the non-manifold data structure and the topological operators, we
	developed a technique to construct 3D freeform objects around a reference
	model. Intuitive 2D sketches are adopted to specify the detail profile
	of the constructed object. The construction method is feature based
	– every reference model has pre-defined features, and the feature
	template of the constructed object is related to the features of
	the reference model by feature node encoding. Therefore, the surfaces
	derived from one reference model can be regenerated automatically
	on another reference model with the same features. The geometry coverage
	of our geometric modeling approach includes both manifold and non-manifold
	3D freeform objects.},
