\preface

Use the template \emph{preface.tex} together with the document class SVMono (monograph-type books) or SVMult (edited books) to style your preface.

A preface\index{preface} is a book's preliminary statement, usually written by the \textit{author or editor} of a work, which states its origin, scope, purpose, plan, and intended audience, and which sometimes includes afterthoughts and acknowledgments of assistance. 

When written by a person other than the author, it is called a foreword. The preface or foreword is distinct from the introduction, which deals with the subject of the work.

Customarily \textit{acknowledgments} are included as last part of the preface.
