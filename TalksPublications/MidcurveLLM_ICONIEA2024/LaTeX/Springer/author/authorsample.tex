\section{Section Heading}
\label{sec:1}
Use the template \emph{chapter.tex} together with the document class SVMono (monograph-type books) or SVMult (edited books) to style the various elements of your chapter content.

Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.  Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your cross-references and citations. And please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

\section{Section Heading}
\label{sec:2}
% Always give a unique label
% and use \ref{<label>} for cross-references
% and \cite{<label>} for bibliographic references
% use \sectionmark{}
% to alter or adjust the section heading in the running head
Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.  Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your cross-references and citations.

Please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

Use the standard \verb|equation| environment to typeset your equations, e.g.
%
\begin{equation}
a \times b = c\;,
\end{equation}
%
however, for multiline equations we recommend to use the \verb|eqnarray| environment\footnote{In physics texts please activate the class option \texttt{vecphys} to depict your vectors in \textbf{\itshape boldface-italic} type - as is customary for a wide range of physical subjects}.
\begin{eqnarray}
\left|\nabla U_{\alpha}^{\mu}(y)\right| &\le&\frac1{d-\alpha}\int
\left|\nabla\frac1{|\xi-y|^{d-\alpha}}\right|\,d\mu(\xi) =
\int \frac1{|\xi-y|^{d-\alpha+1}} \,d\mu(\xi)  \\
&=&(d-\alpha+1) \int\limits_{d(y)}^\infty
\frac{\mu(B(y,r))}{r^{d-\alpha+2}}\,dr \le (d-\alpha+1)
\int\limits_{d(y)}^\infty \frac{r^{d-\alpha}}{r^{d-\alpha+2}}\,dr
\label{eq:01}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Subsection Heading}
\label{subsec:2}
Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.  Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your cross-references\index{cross-references} and citations\index{citations} as has already been described in Sect.~\ref{sec:2}.

\begin{quotation}
Please do not use quotation marks when quoting texts! Simply use the \verb|quotation| environment -- it will automatically be rendered in line with the preferred layout.
\end{quotation}


\subsubsection{Subsubsection Heading}
Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.  Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your cross-references and citations as has already been described in Sect.~\ref{subsec:2}, see also Fig.~\ref{fig:1}\footnote{If you copy text passages, figures, or tables from other works, you must obtain \textit{permission} from the copyright holder (usually the original publisher). Please enclose the signed permission with the manuscript. The sources\index{permission to print} must be acknowledged either in the captions, as footnotes or in a separate section of the book.}

Please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

% For figures use
%
\begin{figure}[b]
\sidecaption
% Use the relevant command for your figure-insertion program
% to insert the figure file.
% For example, with the graphicx style use
\includegraphics[scale=.65]{figure}
%
% If no graphics program available, insert a blank space i.e. use
%\picplace{5cm}{2cm} % Give the correct figure height and width in cm
%
\caption{If the width of the figure is less than 7.8 cm use the \texttt{sidecapion} command to flush the caption on the left side of the page. If the figure is positioned at the top of the page, align the sidecaption with the top of the figure -- to achieve this you simply need to use the optional argument \texttt{[t]} with the \texttt{sidecaption} command}

When placed at the end of a chapter or contribution (as opposed to at the end of the book), the numbering of tables, figures, and equations in the appendix section continues on from that in the main text. Hence please \textit{do not} use the \verb|appendix| command when writing an appendix at the end of your chapter or contribution. If there is only one the appendix is designated ``Appendix'', or ``Appendix 1'', or ``Appendix 2'', etc. if there is more than one.
