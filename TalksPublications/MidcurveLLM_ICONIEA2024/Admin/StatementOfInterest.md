# Predicting the next geometric element, not the next word

I am writing to express my strong interest in the research project titled "Large Language Model for Computing Midcurve of a Thin Polygon." The concept of generating midcurves for 2D geometric profiles using Large Language Models (LLMs) presents an exciting and challenging problem with implications that extend beyond the domain of machine design. As an AI researcher with a focus on natural language processing and machine learning, I am deeply motivated to contribute to this project and explore the boundaries of what LLMs can achieve.

The problem at hand, namely, finding the midcurve of a 2D geometric profile, is a complex and longstanding challenge in the field of computer-aided design. Despite various attempts with traditional geometric techniques like Medial Axis Transform, Chordal Axis Transform, Thinning, and Pairing, the problem remains unsolved due to the diversity and complexity of 2D shapes and their intricate connections. The proposed research project, MidcurveNN, seeks to evaluate whether Neural Networks, and particularly Large Language Models, can provide a solution to this problem.

The problem statement focuses on the goal of generating the midcurve for a closed polygon, which can be represented as a set of connected lines or points. This problem essentially translates to a graph summarization and dimension-reduction task, analogous to text summarization, where the challenge lies in preserving the underlying structure while reducing complexity. It poses several critical questions about how geometric data can be represented, transformed, and summarized in a way that can be fed into neural networks effectively.

One of the key challenges is that geometric shapes are not always easily representable as sequences, unlike language data. Shapes like 'L,' 'I,' and 'T' cannot be directly modeled as sequences of points or lines, making it a non-trivial task for conventional sequence-to-sequence networks. The research aims to explore innovative approaches to represent and convert 2D linear profile shapes into vector forms suitable for neural network processing. This involves addressing the issue of how to incorporate geometric information into graph structures, which inherently possess topological, not geometrical, representations.

The proposed approach of utilizing Large Language Models, such as GPT-4, to generate midcurves by providing prompts is a novel and promising direction. By formulating the problem as a sequence generation task for LLMs, the research explores the potential of these models to understand complex geometric shapes and produce meaningful midcurve representations. The project's findings demonstrate the current limitations of LLMs in handling geometric data while also highlighting their potential for further development.

The research's real-world applications extend beyond the field of machine design. If successful, the ability of LLMs to predict complex geometric structures opens up possibilities in various domains, such as social network analysis, pharmaceutical research, and more, where graph-based data representations are common.

In conclusion, the research project "Large Language Model for Computing Midcurve of a Thin Polygon" aligns with my research interests and expertise in natural language processing and machine learning. I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to address the challenges presented by this project. The potential to expand the capabilities of Large Language Models beyond text and into the realm of complex geometric data is a compelling avenue for exploration, and I am excited to be a part of this research endeavor.
