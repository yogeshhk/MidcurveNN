In the field of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), particularly for thin-walled solids like sheet metal and plastic components, dimensional reduction plays a crucial role in expediting Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) analysis. This is achieved through the creation of Mid-surfaces, defined as surfaces situated equidistantly between the bounding surfaces of the original solid. These Mid-surfaces serve as effective surrogates for analysis, significantly reducing computational complexity. Despite their importance, Mid-surface generation remains a laborious and predominantly manual process due to the scarcity of robust and efficient automated methodologies.

Existing automatic approaches for Mid-surface generation frequently encounter difficulties, leading to problematic artifacts such as gaps, missing patches, and overlapping surfaces. The manual correction of these errors can be incredibly time-consuming, often requiring hours or even days of tedious work. This highlights the urgent need for a reliable and efficient automated process for generating accurate and robust Mid-surfaces.

The concept of Mid-surfaces extends to two-dimensional (2D) planar shapes, where the equivalent is known as the Midcurve. Defined as a curve equidistant from the bounding curves of a 2D profile, the Midcurve provides a simplified representation that retains essential geometric information (ref Fig 1). While various traditional methods exist for Midcurve computation, the challenge of accurately representing complex shapes with diverse connections remains persistent.

The MidcurveNN research project uses Encoder-Decoder neural network for computing Midcurve from images of 2D thin polygons in supervised learning manner. This dimension reduction transformation from input 2D thin polygon image
to output 1D Midcurve image is learnt by the neural network, which can then be used to compute Midcurve of an unseen 2D thin polygonal shape.

The MidcurveLLM research project tackles the challenge of midcurve extraction from 2D geometric profiles, framing it as a Graph Summarization problem analogous to text summarization. It meticulously addresses the specific challenges inherent in this domain, including geometric representation, variable-length input profiles, and branched midcurves. Fine-tuning LLMs using a Boundary Representation (Brep) structure demonstrates potential for overcoming the limitations inherent in sequential point lists. However, challenges remain in LLM fine-tuning, ranging from model quality to dataset size, demanding further investigation and refinement. The complex nature of midcurve generation necessitates ongoing exploration, particularly in conjunction with the evolving capabilities of LLMs. This research opens exciting avenues for scholars and practitioners to delve deeper into the realm of geometric dimension reduction using LLMs, paving the way for significant advancements in shape analysis and representation.
