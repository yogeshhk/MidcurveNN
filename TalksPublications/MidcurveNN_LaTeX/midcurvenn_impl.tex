\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Phase I}

Image to Image Transformation Learning:

\begin{itemize}
\item Img2Img: This phase focuses on learning image-to-image transformation using fixed-size $100 \times 100$ bitmaps.
\item Data Augmentation: The training data will be augmented by scaling, rotating, and translating both input and output shapes within the fixed size.
\item Network Architecture: An Encoder-Decoder network, specifically Semantic Segmentation or Pix2Pix, will be employed for image-based dimension reduction.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Data}

Original input and output are in the form of polylines, meaning a list of points, each having x,y coordinates

\end{center}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item For each shape, we have this pair of input and output. That's it. 
	\item We need to start with these few samples only
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Augmentation}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Such few profile shapes, are  just not enough for Neural Networks to train.
	\item Need more with as much diversity as possible.
	\item Will need to artificially augment data with transformations, like pan, rotate, mirror, etc.
	\item All needs to be automatically, programmatically
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Geometry to Image}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Raw input data is in the Vector format
	\item Converted it to fixed size $(100x100)$ image by rasterization of drawSVG library.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Results}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Not very perfect but encouraging
	\item NN is correct with 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The location (bounding box)
	\item Dimension Reduction is seen
	\end{itemize}	
	\item But, still some stray points and misses
	\end{itemize}	
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What can be done?}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item For the noise, use bounding boxes 
	\item Feedback into error term: differencing with the known output expected 
	\item Classify single pixel image as the skeleton, and rest as noise. 
	\end{itemize}	
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What Next?}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Add denoiser network after the current one
	\item More Network Architectures
	\item Sequence-to-Sequence based approaches, taking closed thin polygon as input and polyline as output
	\item Extending to 3D, ie Midsurface
	\end{itemize}
