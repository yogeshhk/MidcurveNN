\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Summary}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Traditional methods of computing midcurves are predominantly rules-based and thus, have limitation of not developing a generic model which will accept any input shape. 	
	\item A novel Large Language Model based approach attempts to build such a generic model. 
	\item One such model, GPT-4, seems to be very effective. Although other proprietary and open-source models need to catch-up with GPT-4, even GPT-4 needs to be developed further to understand not just sequential lines but graphs/networks with different shapes, essentially, the geometry.
