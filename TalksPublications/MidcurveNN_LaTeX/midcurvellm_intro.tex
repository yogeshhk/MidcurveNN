\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Summary}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Various applications need lower dimensional representation of shapes. 
	\item Midcurve is one- dimensional(1D) representation of a two-dimensional (2D) planar shape. 
	\item Used in animation, shape matching, retrieval, finite element analysis, etc. 
	\end{itemize}	
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Summary}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Approaches: Thinning, Medial Axis Transform (MAT), Chordal Axis Transform (CAT), Straight Skeletons, etc., all of which are rule-based.
	\item Proposing a novel method called MidcurveNN which uses Encoder-Decoder neural network for computing midcurve from images of 2D thin polygons in supervised learning manner. 
	\end{itemize}	
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Summary}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item This dimension reduction transformation from input 2D thin polygon image to output 1D midcurve image is learnt by the neural network,
	\item Which can then be used to compute midcurve of an unseen 2D thin polygonal shape.
