\begin{itemize}
\item Although Model Simplification using geometry has been in practice for many years, with possibility of extracting feature information, it can be taken to the next level. 
\item Feature information gives ready data needed for Model Simplification.  Features such as Pattern leverage the symmetry in the part thereby reducing analysis time-resources. 
\item In Dimension Reduction, it can give tips for creating medial geometries.
\item In the proposed approach Midsurface is concurrently built as part gets created (called forward create). At each feature step, shapes are relatively simple than final shape, thus creation of mid-surfaces at each stage is far simpler. 
\item This approach can build well connected, isomorphic mid-surfaces better than extraction methods.
