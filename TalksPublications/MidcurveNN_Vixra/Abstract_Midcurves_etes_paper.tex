Skeletons are widely used to represent shapes. A 2D or 3D shape is reduced in dimension to a 1-dimensional ``skeleton". Such skeletons are widely used in pattern recognition, matching, finite element analysis etc. Skeletons can be computed for various inputs such as images, solids, sketches etc. Although there are  various methods available for computation of skeletons, their appropriateness depends on requirement posed by their applications. Some focus on exact computation, some are approximate, whereas some aim at faithful backward-reconstruction and some at proper representation for human perception etc.

This paper focuses on creation of skeletons (specifically the ones called 'Midcurves', skeletons that are at the midway of a 2D shape) for polygon. A method based on Divide-and-Conquer strategy has been proposed which works in two phases - Decomposition and Midcurves generation. Towards end of the paper some test-case results are presented along with conclusions.
