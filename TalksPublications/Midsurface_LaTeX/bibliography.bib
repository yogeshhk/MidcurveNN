	is known to be the \u22201 distance between an isotropic quadratic
	function and its linear interpolation on the mesh, our minimization
	procedure generates well-shaped tetrahedra. Mesh design is controlled
	through a gradation smoothness parameter and selection of the desired
	number of vertices. We provide the foundations of our approach by
	explaining both the underlying variational principle and its geometric
	interpretation. We demonstrate the quality of the resulting meshes

	and a user-specified density function defined over it, we first distribute
	the desired number of samples by generalizing error diffusion, commonly
	used in image halftoning, to work directly on mesh triangles and
	feature edges. We then use the resulting sampling as an initial configuration
	for building a weighted centroidal Voronoi diagram in a conformal
	parameter space, where the specified density function is used for
	weighting. We finally create the mesh by lifting the corresponding
	constrained Delaunay triangulation from parameter space. A precise
	control over the sampling is obtained through a flexible design of
	the density function, the latter being possibly low-pass filtered
	to obtain a smoother gradation. We demonstrate the versatility of
	our approach through various remeshing examples.},

  abstract = {Using current Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Finite Element Analysis
	(FEA) pre-processing systems, a large proportion of the analyst's
	time is spent preparing an idealised model of a part or structure
	for analysis. Although complete geometric information for the part
	is often available in the form of a solid model, this is seldom taken
	advantage of because of the amount of time required to simplify and
	idealise the geometry for the subsequent meshing stage. In fact,
	analysts often find it easier to reconstruct the idealised model
	from scratch, a process which is error prone and prohibits linking
	the analysis results to the product in a formal way. This paper gives
	an overview of a future system which would allow and encourage more
	automated CAD-FEA transformation using tools that operate directly
	on the solid model. Functional components for such a system are discussed
	together with issues that should be addressed in order to achieve
	a fully integrated CAD-FEA transformtion scheme. The overall aim
	is to make the transition from a solid model to an idealised model
	suitable for analysis an easier, more robust and less time-consuming

	information required to generate an initial 3D model is implicit
	in the property attributes of initial beam/shell models. As detailed
	designs evolve, equivalent properties in the global model need to
	be updated to account for cumulative and detailed modifications.
	Due to the different requirements of the various classes of simulation,
	procedures for abstracting simpler analysis models from detailed
	geometry are needed. An assessment of the modelling errors arising
	from any given idealisation is a necessity at all stages of the design
	process. There has been substantial progress in these areas, but
	many gaps in functionality remain. An attempt to provide a coherent

  abstract = {A primary shortcoming of existing techniques for hree-dimensional
	(3D) model matching is the reliance on global information of the
	model's structure. Models are matched in their entirety, depending
	on overall topology and geometry information. A currently open challenge
	is how to perform partial matching. Partial matching is important
	for finding similarities across part models with different global
	shape properties and for the segmentation and matching of data acquired
	from 3D scanners. This paper presents a Scale-Space feature extraction
	technique based on recursive decomposition of polyhedral surfaces
	into surface patches. The experimental results presented in this
	paper suggest that this technique can potentially be used to perform
	matching based on local model structure. In our previous work, Scale-Space
	decomposition has been used successfully to extract features from
	mechanical artifacts. Scale-Space techniques can be parameterized
	to generate decompositions that correspond to manufacturing, assembly
	or surface features relevant to mechanical design. One application
	of these technique is to support matching and content-based retrieval
	of solid models. This paper shows how a Scale-Space technique can
	extract features that are invariant with respect to the global structure
	of the model as well as small perturbations that 3D laser scanning
	process introduce. In order to accomplish this, we introduce a new
	distance function defined on triangles instead of points. We believe
	this technique offers a new way to control the feature decomposition
	process, which results in the extraction of features that are more
	meaningful from an engineering viewpoint. The new technique is computationally
	practical for use in indexing large models. Examples are provided
	that demonstrate effective feature extraction on 3D laser scanned
	models. In addition, a simple sub-graph isomorphism algorithm was
	used to show that the feature adjacency graphs, obtained through
	feature extraction, are meaningful descriptors of 3D CAD objects.

  abstract = {Feature modeling has the ability to associate functional and engineering
	information to shape information in a product model. Current feature
	modeling systems, however, are still rather tied to techniques of
	conventional geometric modeling systems, offering limited facilities
	for defining feature semantics, and failing to preserve this semantics
	as the feature model evolves.
	
	
	This thesis presents a new feature modeling approach, called semantic
	feature modeling, which provides a declarative specification scheme
	for the semantics of feature classes. In addition, this semantics
	is correctly maintained for all features in the model, throughout
	the modeling process. The validity maintenance scheme for this monitors
	each modeling operation, assessing the conformity of all features
	with their validity criteria. A validity recovery mechanism provides
	explanations and context-sensitive hints aimed at overcoming each

	to be a key concept in the theory of sampled surfaces. Of particular
	interest is the fact that, if E is an \u03b5-sample of a C2-continuous
	surface S for a sufficiently small \u03b5, then the Delaunay triangulation
	of E restricted to S is a good approximation of S, both in a topological
	and in a geometric sense. Hence, if one can construct an \u03b5-sample,
	one also gets a good approximation of the surface. Moreover, correct
	reconstruction is ensured by various algorithms. In this paper, we
	introduce the notion of loose \u03b5-sample. We show that the set
	of loose \u03b5-samples contains and is asymptotically identical
	to the set of \u03b5-samples. The main advantage of loose \u03b5-samples
	over \u03b5-samples is that they are easier to check and to construct.
	We also present a simple algorithm that constructs provably good
	surface samples and meshes. Given a C2-continuous surface S without
	boundary, the algorithm generates a sparse \u03b5-sample E and at
	the same time a triangulated surface Del|S (E). The triangulated
	surface has the same topological type as S, is close to S for the
	Hausdorff distance and can provide good approximations of normals,
	areas and curvatures. A notable feature of the algorithm is that
	the surface needs only to be known through an oracle that, given
	a line segment, detects whether the segment intersects the surface
	and, in the affirmative, returns the intersection points. This makes
	the algorithm useful in a wide variety of contexts and for a large
	class of surfaces.},

	the uncertainties associated with subsurface data make it desirable
	to modify such models efficiently.We present a method to deform locally
	a surface in a triangulated b-rep while maintaining a constant number
	of spatial regions in the model. This method does not require completely
	rebuilding the model, and thus allows efficient and robust updates
	of the model definition.The method requires that the reshaped surface
	does not intersect the boundaries of its adjoining regions, which
	can be checked using existing collision detection algorithms. Also,
	the non-manifold contacts must be updated after the modification,
	and the triangles must be altered, to maintain sealed regions.For
	this, we propose to parameterize locally the surfaces that the modified
	surface moves along. This parametric space is used to 1) constrain
	the displacement of the deformed surface border and, 2) re-triangulate
	in the plane the neighboring surfaces around the modified contacts.
	The method, tested in the context of an interactive graphical manipulator,
	is very efficient and independent from the deformation mechanism.},

  abstract = {Surface triangular meshing plays an important role in the areas of
	computer graphics and engineering analysis. Traditionally, surface
	meshing is achieved by mapping meshes created in 2D parametric space
	onto surfaces. Care is taken in generating meshes in the parametric
	space and mapping them to surfaces because the transformation of
	geometry from the parameter space to the real space could be extended
	and twisted along some directions. Therefore, a good- looking mesh
	in 2D parametric space could be very poor on a surface. In this paper,
	we present a meshing scheme, which generate Delaunay type triangular
	surface mesh. For each triangle on a surface, its circumcircle is
	mapped into the parametric space, and the geometry of the mapped
	circle in the parametric space is approximated by an ellipse function.
	The triangulation in the parametric space is created and maintained
	using the property of empty circumellipse instead of empty circumcircle.
	Also surface curvature is used to control surface mesh density distribution.
	Therefore, the triangular mesh has a good approximation to the surface
	shape. The implementation of the approach results in very good-quality
	surface mesh.},

	poor quality tetrahedra called slivers that can occur in such a mesh
	can be eliminated by the sliver exudation method. This method has
	been shown to work for periodic point sets, but not with boundaries.
	Recently a randomized point-placement strategy has been proposed
	to remove silvers while conforming to a given boundary. In this paper
	we present a deterministic algorithm for generating a weighted Delaunay
	mesh which respects the input boundary and has no poor quality tetrahedron
	including silvers. This success is achieved by combining the weight
	pumping method for sliver exudation and the Delaunay refinement method
	for boundary conformation. We show that an incremental weight pumping
	can be mixed seamlessly with vertex insertions in our weighted Delaunay
	refinement paradigm.},

	are still not integrated. There is no generic, unified model that
	allows both design and analysis information to be specified. In this
	paper, a feature-based CAD-CAE integration model is proposed to tackle
	the problem. The model comprises a hierarchy of CAD-CAE features
	such as part, wall, hole, rib, boss and treatment. The features are
	defined by their attributes and behaviours. With this model, information
	relating to both design and analysis can be specified and modified.
	The specified information from the design process is used to activate
	relevant CAE analysis routines, thus supporting integration from
	the CAD to the CAE process. If any of the specified design constraints
	is not satisfied from the CAE results, the initial model can be modified
	and the CAE analysis executed again. Hence, the model also supports
	integration from the CAE to the CAD process. A design case illustrates

	model is developed. This model is used to specify the shape-modification
	variables, as well as the mouldability and other quality measuring
	criteria. The shape modification variables include positional and
	sizing parameters of each individual feature, as well as those associated
	with the part, such as part thickness. With this information, an
	iterative process of part-shape modification and execution of simulation
	subroutines is carried out automatically, and the results are verified
	and evaluated. Optimal shape, according to the specified criteria
	can thus be derived from the evaluation results. A software prototype
	has been developed. A design case study is presented to illustrate
	and demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed strategies and methods.},

  booktitle = {Proceedings, 7th International Meshing Roundtable},
  year = {1998},
  pages = {459--478},
  month = {October},
  abstract = {Publications in the domain of three-dimensional unstructured tetrahedral
	mesh generation, adaptation and optimization abound. However, they
	tend to show results only for complex industrial test cases, for
	which comparisons are most often impossible and results are not reproducible.
	Sometimes, only images of the optimized meshes are shown, so that
	it is impossible to tell whether the generation, adaptation or optimization
	process has converged or not. Different statistics on the quality
	of the mesh are used, and tetrahedron shape measures may be unusual.
	
	
	According to the scientific method, one should be able to test a published
	optimization strategy, reproduce results published elsewhere and
	compare these results to the ones obtained with other strategies.
	This is seldom the case in the field of mesh optimization, largely
	because of the lack of standardization of published test cases. It
	is thus felt that the definition of a series of benchmarks that would
	help to establish a basis of comparison constitutes a significant
	contribution to the field of mesh optimization.
	
	
	In this paper, a first series of benchmark test cases is proposed
	that should help compare three-dimensional, optimization meshing
	techniques on tetrahedra. For each case, the inputs of the benchmarks
	are clearly defined ( 2), as well as the measures relating to the
	optimization process ( 3) and the ones pertaining to the quality
	of the results ( 4). These benchmarks are designed to test the generation
	and optimization of unstructured tetrahedral meshes. They are not
	universal or suitable for all meshing problems.
	
	
	The second part of the paper presents the authors own optimization
	strategy, implemented in the ADP3D package ( 5). The benchmarking
	process is initialized by evaluating the results of ADP3D ( 6) followed
	by an analysis of the results ( 7).
	
	
	Finally, we conclude that using the benchmarks helps to evaluate the
	results of tetrahedral mesh optimization algorithms. We feel that
	the Meshing Roundtable is a good forum to discuss this benchmarks
	proposal and that it will encourage its use.},

  title = {Automated generation of {F.E.A} models through idealization operators},
  booktitle = {2nd Symposium on Trends in Unstructured Mesh Generation},
  year = {1999},
  abstract = {The use of Finite Element Analysis (F.E.A) during a design process
	is often restricted to validation phases because of the time needed
	to generate the mechanical model used for an analysis. Indeed, the
	generation of F.E.A. models needs a significant expertise from engineers
	to avoid computer resources to be wasted. To save engineers time,
	such models ought to be generated as automatically as possible. To
	this end, automatic processes that generate meshes directly from
	CAD data are more and more incorporated into F.E. softwares.
	
	
	These idealizations are carried out through a vertex removal process
	which transforms geometry of a part according to a discrete envelope
	defined around its initial geometry[4]. This envelope is generated
	from a mechanical criterion which can be based either on an a posteriori
	error estimator [5][6] or on a priori estimation. The use of this
	criterion ensures that all geometric transformations which keep the
	geometry of the part within this envelope do not significantly change
	the results of the F.E.A. More than strictly respecting this envelop,
	operators used for idealization are also able to transfer specific
	data (like boundary conditions) from initial to idealized geometry.
	Such operators allow a broader automation of geometry simplification
	and idealization and ensure that the new geometry is more suited
	to the element size requirements attached to the mesh generation
	process.
	
	
	The insertion of mechanical criteria into the process of geometry
	adaption, as presented in this paper, adds flexibility to F.E.A.
	tools, thus improving their integration into the design process.
	This approach is illustrated and validated through an example.},

	High-quality meshes are obtained in a computationally efficient manner

	problems) in various engineering applications. The crucial requisite
	of this modeling method is the construction of a suitable mesh which
	further serves as a spatial support for the governing equations of
	the problem to be solved.
	
	
	Depending on the complexity of the geometry to be modeled and on the
	space dimension, there exist various mesh generation methods. Apart
	from some specific geometries, unstructured mesh generation methods
	proved to be a solution capable to handle arbitrarily shaped domains.
	In general, such methods produce triangles (in two dimensions) and
	tetrahedra (in three dimensions). Most techniques currently in use
	for this purpose fit into one of the three main types: octree based,
	advancing-front based or Delaunay like techniques
	
	
	In this paper we briefly describe the two first types of methods and
	we focus on the third one. Hence, Delaunay triangulation issues are
	recalled and the way in which the corresponding procedures apply
	for mesh construction purposes is discussed. Various aspects are
	included in the discussion, some coming from the Computational Geometry,
	some more clearly related to a Finite Element context, some regarding
	the numerical troubles that necessarily arise in the computer implementation
	of any mesh generation procedure.

  abstract = {Many physical phenomena in science and engineering can be modeled
	by partial differential equations and solved by means of the finite
	element method. Such a method uses as computational spatial support
	a mesh of the domain where the equations are formulated. The ‚Äòmesh
	quality‚Äô is a key-point for the accuracy of the numerical simulation.
	One can show that this quality is related to the shape and the size
	of the mesh elements. In the case where the element sizes are not
	specified in advance, a quality mesh is a regular mesh (whose elements
	are almost equilateral). This problem is a particular case of a more
	general mesh generation problem whose purpose is to construct meshes
	conforming to a prespecified isotropic size field associated with
	the computational domain. Such meshes can be seen as ‚Äòunit meshes‚Äô
	(whose elements are of unit size) in an appropriate non-Euclidean
	metric. In this case, a quality mesh of the domain is a unit mesh
	as regular as possible. In this paper, we are concerned with the
	generation of such a mesh and we propose a method to achieve this
	goal. First, the boundary of the domain is meshed using an indirect
	scheme via parametric domains and then the mesh of the three-dimensional
	(3D) domain is generated. In both cases, an empty mesh is first constructed,
	then enriched by field points, and finally optimized. The field points
	are defined following an algebraic or an advancing-front approach
	and are connected using a generalized Delaunay type method. To show
	the overall meshing process, we give an example of a 3D domain encountered
	in a classical computational fluid dynamics problem.},

	between polyhedral models is quickly, accurately, and automatically
	calculated by comparing Multiresolutional Reeb Graphs (MRGs). The
	MRG thus operates well as a search key for 3D shape data sets. In
	particular, the MRG represents the skeletal and topological structure
	of a 3D shape at various levels of resolution. The MRG is constructed
	using a continuous function on the 3D shape, which may preferably
	be a function of geodesic distance because this function is invariant
	to translation and rotation and is also robust against changes in
	connectivities caused by a mesh simplification or subdivision. The
	similarity calculation between 3D shapes is processed using a coarse-to-fine
	strategy while preserving the consistency of the graph structures,
	which results in establishing a correspondence between the parts
	of objects. The similarity calculation is fast and efficient because
	it is not necessary to determine the particular pose of a 3D shape,
	such as a rotation, in advance. Topology Matching is particularly
	useful for interactively searching for a 3D object because the results
	of the search fit human intuition well.},

	mesh is commonly generated as a quasi-uniform mesh in the metric

	for anisotropic mesh generation and adaptation. In this paper, we
	develop a general formula for the metric tensor for use in any spatial

	preserving interpolation on simiplicial elements. Numerical results
	in two-dimensions are presented to demonstrate the ability of the

	and good overall quality. The procedure developed in this paper for

  abstract = {A detailed CAD model needs manual clean-up, or simplifying operations,
	before a finite element mesh can be automatically generated because
	such a model consists of hundreds or thousands of faces many of which
	may be smaller than a desired mesh element size. We propose an automated
	face clustering method used as a pre-process of surface mesh generation.
	By decomposing a model into face clusters so that each region can
	be projected onto a simple parametric surface such as a plane, we
	obtain a final mesh as an aggregate of sub-meshes for respective
	clusters without time-consuming manual preparation work. The projection
	onto a surface realizes re-parameterization as well as suppression
	of small details. The main contribution of this work is the integration
	of (1) a greedy algorithm for combining faces into clusters, and
	(2) geometric indices that reflect various aspects of a preferable
	shape for a cluster. The validity of the approach is demonstrated
	with results of clustering and mesh generation for a realistic-scale
	CAD model.},

	they differ by a rotation. Consequently, when comparing two models,a
	similarity metric implicitly provides the measure of similarity at
	the optimal alignment. Explicitly solving for the optimal alignment
	is usually impractical. So, two general methods have been proposed
	for addressing this issue: (1) Every model is represented using rotation
	invariant descriptors. (2) Every model is described by a rotation
	dependent descriptor that is aligned into a canonical coordinate
	system defined by the model. In this paper, we describe the limitations
	of canonical alignment and discuss an alternate method, based on
	spherical harmonics, for obtaining rotation invariant representations.
	We describe the properties of this tool and show how it can be applied
	to a number of existing, orientation dependent descriptors toimprove
	their matching performance. The advantages of this tool are two-fold:
	First, it improves the matching performance of many descriptors.
	Second, it reduces the dimensionality of the descriptor, providing
	a more compact representation, which in turn makes comparing two
	models more efficient.},

	the exact Voronoi diagram of a circle set from the Voronoi diagram
	of a point set. The circles are located in a two dimensional Euclidean
	space, the radii of the circles are non-negative and not necessarily
	equal, and the circles are allowed to intersect each other.The idea
	of the algorithm is to use the topology of the point set Voronoi
	diagram as a seed so that the correct topology of the circle set
	Voronoi diagram can be obtained through a number of edge flipping
	operations. Then, the geometries of the Voronoi edges of the circle
	set Voronoi diagram are computed. In particular, this paper discusses
	the topology aspect of the algorithm, and the following paper discusses
	the geometrical aspect.The main advantages of the proposed algorithm
	are in its robustness, speed, and the simplicity in its concept as
	well as implementation. Since the algorithm is based on the result
	of the point set Voronoi diagram and the flipping operation is the
	only topological operation, the algorithm is always as stable as
	the Voronoi diagram construction algorithm of a point set.The worst-case
	time complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(n2), where n is the
	number of generators. However, the experiment with several cases
	shows a strong linear increase of the computation time.},

	In this work some typical cases, where exact and accurate solutions

	are achieved also for changes in a small number of elements or when
	the angle between the two vectors representing the initial design

	(3D) surface is defined by a set of ?simpler surfaces? called ?patches?.
	Although there are many different ways to specify a patch, a common
	case is that of a 4-sided patch represented by a structured grid
	of points. For instance, this kind of data can easily be obtained
	from a CAD system, as it is the mapping of regularly spaced points
	in a rectangular parametric domain. It can also be obtained from
	some particular 3D scanning devices. Non-rectangular topologies may
	also be encountered, for instance the 3-sided patch which can be
	considered as a degenerate case of the 4-sided patch (one side being
	of zero length). In this paper, we use the Coons method to build
	a surface interpolating the vertices of such a grid. The continuity
	of this parameterization makes it suitable for our indirect approach
	to surface meshing, which is generally based on the generation of
	an anisotropic mesh in the parametric space. Moreover, the indirect
	approach has been extended to the construction of anisotropic geometric
	surface meshes in 3D space, allowing an accurate geometric representation
	of the surface with a minimal number of elements. Several examples
	demonstrate the capabilities of this method.},

	simulation environments. While this has enabled highly complex and
	detailed models to be used earlier in the design process it has brought
	with it difficulties for simulation specialists. Most notably CAD
	models now contain many details which are irrelevant to simulation
	disciplines. CAD systems have feature trees which record feature
	creation but unfortunately this does not capture which features are
	relevant to which analysis discipline. Many features of little significance
	to an analysis only emerge during the construction of the model.
	The ability to selectively suppress and reinstate features while
	maintaining an audit trail of changes is required to facilitate the
	control of the idealisation process. Features suppressed for one
	analysis can be retrieved for use in another.This work uses combinatorial
	topology concepts to outline the necessary conditions so that CAD
	model simplification operations can be designed as continuous transformations.
	Irrelevant features can then be suppressed and subsequently reinstated,
	within defined limitations, independently from the order in which
	they were suppressed. The implementation of these concepts provides
	analysts with a mechanism for generating analysis models with different
	levels of detail, without having to repeat the simplification process
	from the original CAD geometry. Most importantly, the information
	recorded during the suppress operations forms an essential audit
	trail of the idealisation process and can be presented in a feature-tree
	like structure allowing analysts to review their modelling decisions
	retrospectively. The approach also facilitates the generation of
	local, detailed models encapsulating a feature of interest. The proposed
	system follows a Find and Fix paradigm; where different algorithms
	for feature finding and fixing can be utilised in a common cellular
	modelling framework.},

  abstract = {Virtual prototyping through simulation is being widely adopted as
	part of the product design cycle. However, designers often find themselves
	crippled by the limitation of exiting technologies when dealing with
	real world CAD models. CAD models often contain details for aesthetic
	and manufacturing purposes which are irrelevant or even harmful to
	the analysis. It is always a tedious and time consuming task to clean-up
	CAD geometry in preparation for mesh generation. Typically the designer
	will perform a preliminary analysis to evaluate every possible high-risk
	region in the conceptual design and then improve the design and rerun
	the analysis for confirmation. This iterative practice is extremely
	time consuming and labour intensive for a complicated model; for
	example a gearbox assembly will typically has 2,000,000~2,500,000
	DOF. Unfortunately it is also critical for designer to follow this
	approach in order to fine-tune their designs. It is the aim of this
	research to fuse the gaps in current practices and technologies for
	a seamless integration of the CAD-to-CAE process. A series of algorithmic
	procedures for small feature identification is presented. The Medial
	Axis Transform (MAT) is used in these procedures to provide geometric
	proximity information. When used in conjunction with global tolerances,
	the simplification process can be orchestrated to cater for different
	types of models and account for relative size of the feature. Model
	simplification enables the designer to create a coarsest possible
	mesh for an efficient preliminary analysis. Coarse mesh enables analysts
	shorten the analysis time, and identify hot spots from the analysis
	results more quickly. Most of these hot spots will require a much
	finer mesh to capture their true local behaviour. This paper will
	also provide an intuitive method for mesh refinement while respecting
	the original CAD geometries.},

	at least as far as the plane on which the mesh would have element

	checking for intersections between triangles, making the surface
	intersection and mesh generation a quasi-linear process with respect

	between two triangles, four fundamental cases are identified and
	treated systematically to enhance robustness and reliability. Tracing
	the neighbours for the determination of intersection lines not only
	greatly increases the efficiency of the process, it also improves
	the reliability as branching and degenerated cases can all be dealt
	with in a consistent manner on the intersecting surfaces concerned.
	Five examples on a great variety of surface and mesh characteristics

  abstract = {Considerable progress has been made on automatic hexahedral mesh generation
	in recent years. A few automated meshing algorithms (e.g. mapping,
	submapping, sweeping) have proven to be very reliable on certain
	classes of geometry. While it is always worth pursuing general algorithms
	viable on arbitrary geometry, a combination of the well-established
	algorithms is ready to take on classes of complicated geometry. By
	partitioning the entire geometry into meshable pieces matched with
	appropriate meshing algorithms, the original geometry becomes meshable
	and may achieve better mesh quality. Each meshable portion is recognized
	as a meshing feature. This paper, which is a part of the feature
	based meshing methodology, presents the work on shape recognition
	and volume decomposition to automatically decompose a CAD model into
	hex meshable volumes. There are four phases in this approach: Feature
	Determination to extract decomposition features; Cutting Surfaces
	Generation to form the cutting surfaces; Body Decomposition to get
	the imprinted volumes; and Meshing Algorithm Assignment to match
	volumes decomposed with appropriate meshing algorithms. This paper
	focuses on describing feature determination and volume decomposition;
	the last part has been described in another paper. The feature determination
	procedure is based on the CLoop feature recognition algorithm that
	is extended to be more general. Some decomposition and meshing results

	For this improvement an already existing method was used: local transformations,
	so called flips, performed in order to improve different geometrical
	properties of tetrahedra and applied to the finished 3D Delaunay
	triangulation. We examined this method by using various criteria
	to compare their benefits and losses in the area of the tetrahedra
	shape or time demand. We found out that the greatest benefit comes
	from the so called compound criteria and from the criterion which
	minimizes the numbers of tetrahedra. Other criteria have no positive
	influence on mesh improvement, they rather degrade the quality of
	the Delaunay mesh. The question of time is not so important, because

  abstract = {It is well known that hexahedra; i.e., brick elements, provide superior
	performance to tetrahedra in certain types of finite element analysis,
	notably dynamic cases and in processes such as welding in which elasto-plastic
	boundaries and phase changes are present. The development of robust
	and complete free meshing schemes for hexahedra has been problematic.
	Typically, the user employs time consuming mapped meshing to create
	the necessary hexahedral meshes. On the other hand, complex geometries
	can be quickly free meshed, or populated, with tetrahedra, a main
	stay of commercial CAD/CAM packages. This does not require the time
	consuming operations of mapped meshing with hexahedra. Clearly, there
	is a need for a simple tetrahedra-to-hexahedra (TTH) conversion algorithm,
	which exploits the advantages of tetrahedral meshing. The development
	and testing of a TTH algorithm is presented. It uses a simple splitting
	method in which each hexahedron is divided into four hexahedra. A
	number of mesh optimization routines are implemented to improve the
	overall quality of the resulting finite element mesh. It is shown
	that the TTH algorithm is capable of handling a variety of geometries
	incorporating features typical in finite element analysis. While
	poorly formed elements cannot be entirely eliminated, the resulting
	meshes are useful. A number of initiatives in the continued development
	of the TTH are also presented.},

  abstract = {Design and analysis are two key aspects of the product development
	process, which is iterative by nature and requires knowledge from
	several different domains. For example, designers devise product
	specifications based on required functions, whereas, analysis experts
	analyze the behavior of the resulting product using various models
	to verify that the design meets required functions. Should analysis
	results indicate unacceptable behavior, the design is sent back to
	designers for modification, resulting in an often costly, iterative
	loop between design and analysis that repeats itself throughout the
	product development process. Significant cost and time savings can
	be achieved by reducing this iteration between designers and analysts.
	In this paper, we present a knowledge-based framework for integrating
	design and analysis activities, aimed at reducing the associated
	iterations. Specific research issues presented in this paper include
	developing a knowledge-based repository of analysis models and a
	means for extracting appropriate models from the repository. The
	concept of a design model hyperspace is proposed for storing analysis
	models in a hierarchical fashion, based on idealization levels. The
	associations between design and analysis models are captured using
	flexible associativities between them. The knowledge-based framework
	is presented in the context of multifunctional design of Linear Cellular

  abstract = {Given a triangulated surface with arbitrary genus, the set of its
	cut-graphs depends on the underlying topology and the selection of
	a specific one should be guided by the surface geometry and targeted
	applications. Most of the previous work on this topic uses mesh traversal
	techniques for the evaluation of the geodesic metric, and therefore
	the cut-graphs are influenced by the mesh connectivity. Our solution
	is to build up the cut-graph on the iso-contours of a function ,
	that cut the topological handles of , and on the completion of the
	cut-graph on the planar domain. In the planar domain, geodesic curves
	are defined by line segments whose counterparts on , with respect
	to a diffeomorphism , are smooth approximations of geodesic paths.
	Our method defines a family of cut-graphs of which can target different
	applications, such as global parameterization with respect to different
	criteria (e.g., minimal length, minimization of the parameterization
	distortion, or interpolation of points as required by remeshing and
	texture mapping) or the calculation of polygonal schemes for surface
	classification. The proposed approach finds a cut-graph of an arbitrary
	triangle mesh with n vertices and b boundary components in O((b -
	1)n) time if has 0-genus, and O(n(log(n) + 2g + b - 1)) time if g
	[greater-or-equal, slanted] 1. The associated polygonal schema is
	reduced if g = 0, and it has a constant number of redundant edges
	otherwise.},

	automatically generate an all quad mesh using the medial axis transform
	(MAT). LayTracks combines the merits of two popular direct techniques
	for quad mesh generation - Quad meshing by decomposition and Advancing
	front quad meshing. The algorithm uses the MAT to lay rails across
	an arbitrary set of connected planar patches. Each rail starts from
	a node on the boundary and propagates towards the MA and then from
	the MA towards the boundary. Quadrilateral elements are then obtained
	by placing nodes on these rails and connecting them inside each track
	formed by adjacent rails. Spacing between the rails and between the
	nodes on the rails are fixed at the boundary of the region. The medial
	axis therefore serves as the natural termination for the propagation
	of both the rail and the mesh. The algorithm uses the medial axis
	transform to both decompose the region and avoid the expensive interference
	checks of advancing front method. The algorithm has been implemented
	and used to generate an all quad mesh on a set of connected planar
	patches in 3-D space. Extension of the technique to adaptive meshing
	and all hexahedral meshing is discussed.}

	sizing function is proposed. The computational procedure has three
	main steps: (1) Generation of source points that determine the size
	and gradient at certain points on the surface; (2) generation of
	an octree lattice for storing the sizing function; and (3) interpolation
	of mesh size on the lattice. The source points are generated automatically

	a robust update (regeneration) of the solid's boundary representation,

	formal definition for boundary representation. (BR-)deformation for

	in small changes in the solid's boundary reprentation, which may

	The necessary conditions that must be satisfied by any BR-deforming
	mappings between boundary representations are powerful enough to
	identify invalid updates in many (but not all) practical situations,

	Our technique is a novel advancing front algorithm, that bounds the

	we introduce a way of augmenting advancing front algorithms with
	global information, so that triangle size adapts gracefully even
	when there are large changes in surface curvature. Our results show
	that our technique generates high-quality triangulations where other

  abstract = {Isosurfaces are ubiquitous in many fields, including visualization,
	graphics, and vision. They are often the main computational component
	of important processing pipelines (e.g. , surface reconstruction),
	and are heavily used in practice. The classical approach to compute
	isosurfaces is to apply the Marching Cubes algorithm, which although
	robust and simple to implement, generates surfaces that require additional
	processing steps to improve triangle quality and mesh size. An important
	issue is that in some cases, the surfaces generated by Marching Cubes
	are irreparably damaged, and important details are lost which can
	not be recovered by subsequent processing. The main motivation of
	this work is to develop a technique capable of constructing high-quality
	and high-fidelity isosurfaces. We propose a new advancing front technique
	that is capable of creating high-quality isosurfaces from regular
	and irregular volumetric datasets. Our work extends the guidance
	field framework of Schreiner et al. to implicit surfaces, and improves
	it in significant ways. In particular, we describe a set of sampling
	conditions that guarantee that surface features will be captured
	by the algorithm. We also describe an efficient technique to compute
	a minimal guidance field, which greatly improves performance. Our
	experimental results show that our technique can generate high-quality

  abstract = {Remeshing of 3D meshes is important for many CAD, visualization and
	analysis applications. Current remeshing methods for closed manifold
	genus-g meshes usually involve 3D mesh operations, such as splitting
	and merging the mesh edges, in order to construct a new mesh that
	will satisfy given geometrical criteria. These 3D operations are
	local and usually do not lead to the desired new mesh. Indeed, the
	remeshed model usually does not satisfy regular criteria. Moreover,
	changing one of the criteria will lead to reactivating the remeshing
	process from scratch.In this paper, we propose a novel remeshing
	approach which overcomes the above problems. It can be applied on
	3D genus-g meshes (g>0) which are 2D manifold and triangular. The
	proposed approach is based on continuously mapping a 2D grid on the
	3D genus-g meshes. The criteria of the new mesh can be defined directly
	on the 2D grid. The remeshing is invariant to the original triangular
	mesh. The mapping is based on a new parameterization technique, also
	developed by the authors, which utilizes the topologic analysis of
	the object. As a result, the mapping of the 2D grid into a 3D mesh
	minimizes distortion and guarantees continuity. In addition, the
	2D grid, element shapes and density can be modified straightforwardly,
	thus making the approach modular. In the paper, the remeshing approach
	and the parameterization (mapping) technique are described in detail,
	and the feasibility of the remeshing method is demonstrated on complex

  abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm to generate an all-hexahedral mesh
	of a multi-domain solid model using a hybrid grid-based approach.
	This is based on a projective concept during the boundary adaptation
	of the initial mesh. In general, the algorithm involves the generation
	of a grid structure, which is superimposed on the solid model. This
	grid structure forms an initial mesh consisting of hexahedral elements,
	which intersect fully or partially with the solid model. This initial
	mesh is then shrunk in an outside-in manner to the faces of the model
	through a node projection process using the closest position approach.
	To match the resulting mesh to the edges of the model, a minimal
	deformation angle method is used. Finally, to match the vertices
	with the nodes on the mesh, a minimal warp angle method is employed.
	To create the mesh of a multi-domain solid model, an outside-in and
	inside-in hybrid of the grid-based method is used. This hybrid method
	ensures that the meshes of the different domains are conforming at
	their common boundary. This paper also describes two methods for
	resolving cases of degenerate elements: a splitting technique and
	a wedge insertion technique.},

  abstract = {A numerical method for the solution of a partial differential equation
	(PDE) requires the following steps: (1) discretizing the domain (mesh
	generation); (2) using an approximation method and the mesh to transform
	the problem into a linear system; (3) solving the linear system.
	The approximation error and convergence of the numerical method depend
	on the geometric quality of the mesh, which in turn depends on the
	size and shape of its elements. For example, the shape quality of
	a triangular mesh is measured by its element's aspect ratio
	
	
	In this work, we shift the focus to the geometric properties of the
	nodes, rather than the elements, of well shaped meshes. We introduce
	the concept of well-spaced points and their spacing functions, and
	show thatthese enable the development of simple and efficient algorithms
	for the different stages of the numerical solution of PDEs
	
	
	We first apply well-spaced point sets and their accompanying technology
	to mesh coarsening, a crucial stepin the multigrid solution of a
	PDE. A good aspect-ratio coarsening sequence of an unstructured mesh
	M0 is a sequence of good aspect-ratio meshes M1; : : : ; Mk such
	that Mi is an approximation of Mi\Gamma 1 containing fewer nodes
	and elements. We present a new approach to coarsening that guarantees
	the sequence is alsoof optimal size and width up to a constant factor
	-- the first coarsening method that provides these guarantees. We
	also present experimental results, based on an implementation of
	our approach, that substantiate the theoretical claims.
	
	
	In three dimensions, we apply well-spaced points to mesh generation.
	We introduce a new aspectratio condition, the radius-edge ratio,
	which corresponds to well-spaced points. Radius-edge ratio is weaker
	than the standard aspect-ratio condition in that it allows slivers.
	Nonetheless, we show that a Delaunay mesh of bounded radius-edge
	ratio has geometric structure properties that are reminiscent of
	a bounded standard aspect-ratio mesh: the mesh is a density graph
	and its Voronoi cells are well-shaped. We finally show how to construct
	such meshes to conform to an input domain.},

	3D shapes has led to an explosion in the number of available 3D models

	the development of 3D shape retrieval systems that, given a query
	object, retrieve similar 3D objects. For visualization, 3D shapes
	are often represented as a surface, in particular polygonal meshes,
	for example in VRML format. Often these models contain holes, intersecting
	polygons, are not manifold, and do not enclose a volume unambiguously.
	On the contrary, 3D volume models, such as solid models produced
	by CAD systems, or voxels models, enclose a volume properly. This
	paper surveys the literature on methods for content based 3D retrieval,
	taking into account the applicability to surface models as well as
	to volume models. The methods are evaluated with respect to several

	representation requirements, (2) properties of dissimilarity measures,
	(3) efficiency, (4) discrimination abilities, (5) ability to perform

  abstract = {We present a tetrahedral mesh generation algorithm designed for the
	Lagrangian simulation of deformable bodies. The algorithm\u2019s
	input is a level set (i.e., a signed distance function on a Cartesian
	grid or octree). First a bounding box of the object is covered with
	a uniform lattice of subdivision-invariant tetrahedra. The level
	set is then used to guide a red green adaptive subdivision procedure
	that is based on both the local curvature and the proximity to the
	object boundary. The final topology is carefully chosen so that the
	connectivity is suitable for large deformation and the mesh approximates
	the desired shape. Finally, this candidate mesh is compressed to
	match the object boundary. To maintain element quality during this
	compression phase we relax the positions of the nodes using finite
	elements, masses and springs, or an optimization procedure. The resulting
	mesh is well suited for simulation since it is highly structured,
	has topology chosen specifically for large deformations, and is readily
	refined if required during subsequent simulation. We then use this
	algorithm to generate meshes for the simulation of skeletal muscle
	from level set representations of the anatomy. The geometric complexity
	of biological materials makes it very difficult to generate these
	models procedurally and as a result we obtain most if not all data
	from an actual human subject. Our current method involves using voxelized
	data from the Visible Male [1] to create level set representations
	of muscle and bone geometries. Given this representation, we use
	simple level set operations to rebuild and repair errors in the segmented
	data as well as to smooth aliasing inherent in the voxelized data.},

  title = {Deformable solid modeling via medial sampling and displacement subdivision},
  school = {UNC-Chapel Hill},
  year = {2004},
  abstract = {Discrete m-reps use tolerance-based, sampled medial skeleta as an
	underlying framework for boundaries defined by displaced subdivision
	surfaces. They provide local and global shape information, combining
	the strengths of multiscale skeletal modeling with the multi-resolution,
	deformation and shading properties afforded by subdivision surfaces.
	Hierarchically linked medial figures allow figural, object-based
	deformation, and their stability of object representation with respect
	to boundary perturbation shows advantages of tolerance-based medial
	representations over Blum axis and Voronoi-based skeletal models.
	
	
	M-rep models provide new approaches to traditional computer graphics
	modeling, to physically based modeling and simulation, and to image-analysis,
	segmentation and display, by combining local and object-level deformability
	and by explicitly including object-scale, tolerance and hierarchical
	level-of-detail. Sampled medial representations combine the solid
	modeling capabilities of constructive solid geometry with the flexibility
	of traditional b-reps, to which they add multiscale medial and boundary
	deformations parameterized by an object-based coordinate system.
	
	
	This thesis research encompassed conceptual development on discrete
	m-reps and their implementation for MIDAG (the Medical Image Display
	and Analysis Group) at UNC-Chapel Hill. Prototype and application
	code was created to support the following: medial atoms in 3D that
	included a quaternion frame to establish a local coordinate system;
	data structures for medial mesh topologies; a new algorithm for interpolating
	Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces for m-rep boundaries; a medially
	based coordinate system parameterizing the m-rep boundary, interior,
	and local exterior; displacement texturing and displacement meshing
	of m-rep boundaries; methods of medially based deformation; figure/subfigure
	blending by implicit surface methods or (with Qiong Han) using remeshing
	of subdivision boundaries; and C++ code libraries for m-rep modeling
	in geometric design and image-segmentation applications.
	
	
	Along with discussion of these achievements, this document also includes
	discussions of current m-rep applications and of design-methodology
	issues for m-rep-based modeling systems.},

  abstract = {Simplification of polyhedral models, which may incorporate large numbers
	of faces and nodes, is often required to reduce their amount of data,
	to allow their efficient manipulation, and to speed up computation.
	Such a simplification process must be adapted to the use of the resulting
	polyhedral model. Several applications require simplified shapes
	which have the same topology as the original model (e.g. reverse
	engineering, medical applications, etc.). Nevertheless, in the fields
	of structural analysis and computer visualization, for example, several
	adaptations and idealizations of the initial geometry are often necessary.
	To this end, within this paper a new approach is proposed to simplify
	an initial manifold or non-manifold polyhedral model with respect
	to bounded errors specified by the user, or set up, for example,
	from a preliminary F.E. analysis. The topological changes which may
	occur during a simplification because of the bounded error (or tolerance)
	values specified are performed using specific curvature and topological
	criteria and operators. Moreover, topological changes, whether or

	exchange in IDEs. In particular, this framework integrates two key
	components: (a) incremental editing that allows solid models to be
	edited, modified, and propagated in an incremental form, and (b)
	progressive streaming that enables solid models to be stored, retrieved,
	transmitted, and reconstructed in a progressive manner. The benefits
	of this framework include obtaining real-time interaction with complex
	geometry, and obviating the burden of transferring large amounts
	of data over networks.},

  abstract = {Faceted/meshed models play an important role in product development
	cycle. Due to the fact that such models typically involve huge amounts
	of data, the exchanging of them in network-based integrated design
	environments (IDEs) is a critical issue. In this paper, an approach
	known as incremental editing is presented to expedite such a data
	exchange process through tracking changed portions of a faceted model
	after it has been edited at one application, transmitting these portions,
	and finally embedding them into the associated faceted model at another
	application. This new approach is expected to bring two benefits
	to current IDEs: (a) the editing of a faceted model at an application
	can be done without completely reconstructing all its underlying
	facets, and (b) the consistency between faceted models in different
	applications can be maintained without repeatedly transferring large
	amounts of facet data over computer networks.},

	the composition of behavioral fields are developed in this paper.
	The composition of behavioral fields is carried out in a manner that
	is procedurally similar to composition of primitive geometrical entities
	through set theoretic Boolean operations in constructive solid geometry.
	The methodology is shown to lead to a tighter integration between
	design and analysis and is termed constructive solid analysis. A
	meshless approximation using non-uniform rational B-spline basis
	functions is used to discretize the behavioral fields defined over
	the geometrical primitives. Remeshing, which is a critical bottleneck
	in shape optimization using conventional finite element analysis
	is either eliminated or limited to those primitives that are modified.
	Further, it is demonstrated that the reconstruction of stiffness
	matrices is required only for those geometrical primitives that are
	affected by the design changes. Design sensitivity analysis techniques
	are developed for the discretized solution system arising out of
	the compositional analysis. An adaptive numerical integration scheme
	is developed and shown to be necessary to accurately compute the
	effect of small domain perturbations on the problem functions. Some
	of the common challenges in conventional shape optimization problems
	such as difficulty in creating and merging multiple holes are naturally
	resolved using the developed compositional approach. Several representative
	problems are solved to validate and to demonstrate the methodology.},
