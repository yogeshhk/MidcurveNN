## Prompt:

```
You are an expert in Geometric Modeling algorithms as well as Artificial Intelligence. You are working on a problem called 'Midcurve Computation' and exploring which approaches are possible.

'Midcurve Computation' is essentially a dimension reduction problem on shapes. Graph Summarization/Dimension-Reduction/Compression: Reducing a large graph to a smaller graph preserving its underlying structure, similar to text summarization, which attempts to keep the essence.

Here,

- Input is 2D profile, say a closed polygon. Example: thick ‘L’ profile.
- Output is 1D curve in the middle of the profile. 
- 2D shapes are represented as graph, where vertices as nodes, connecting curves as edges.


Wish to build encoder-decoder network which accepts graphs as input as well as output.
Training set of such input and output graphs pairs is available for any supervised approach.

Main considerations:
- The limitation with Seq2Seq models is notable; the input polygons and output branched midcurves are not linearly connected. They may exhibit loops or branches, necessitating further consideration for a more suitable solution.
- It poses a variable input and variable output challenge, given that the number of points and lines differs in the input and output.
- For Encoder-Decoder networks like those in Tensorflow, fixed-length inputs are necessary. Introducing variable lengths poses a significant hurdle as padding with a distinct unused value, such as 0,0, is not feasible, considering it could represent a valid point.

Similar to Seq2Seq models, are there graph2graph models available suitable for above problem? Any ideas?
```

## Response:

Indeed, there are several graph-to-graph neural network approaches that you can consider for this problem. Since both your input (a 2D polygon graph) and output (a 1D midcurve graph) have variable sizes and complex connectivity (with loops, branches, etc.), you'll want architectures that naturally handle such irregular data without forcing a sequential or fixed-length representation.

Here are some ideas and approaches:

1. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as Encoders:**  
   Use GNNs (such as Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks, or Message Passing Neural Networks) to encode the input graph. These networks are designed to work on graphs directly and can aggregate information from neighbors in a permutation-invariant manner. This avoids the need for fixed-length input representations or arbitrary padding.

2. **Graph Decoders / Generative Models:**  
   For the decoder, you could explore graph generative models. Options include:
   - **Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAEs):** These learn a latent representation of graphs and then reconstruct the graph.  
   - **GraphRNN:** An autoregressive model that generates graphs sequentially (node by node and edge by edge) while handling variable-sized outputs.  
   - **Conditional Graph Generative Models:** Adaptations of GANs or VAEs that condition the output on a latent representation from the encoder.

3. **Graph-to-Graph Translation Architectures:**  
   Similar in spirit to Seq2Seq but designed for graphs, these architectures combine a GNN encoder with a graph decoder. They can be trained end-to-end on paired graph data (input polygon and target midcurve). The decoder typically has to predict both node features (e.g., positions) and edge connectivity, which is a challenging but active area of research.

4. **Attention-Based Graph Models:**  
   Recent advances in graph transformer architectures can capture long-range dependencies and complex interactions within the graph. This could be beneficial for capturing the essence of the 2D shape and translating it to a meaningful midcurve.

**Key Considerations:**
- **Permutation Invariance:** Graph models naturally handle variable node orderings without needing padding that might conflict with valid data.
- **Variable Input/Output Sizes:** Both the encoder and decoder in these architectures are designed to operate on graphs of arbitrary sizes.
- **Loss Functions and Training:** You’ll need a loss function that accounts for the structure of the output graph, possibly incorporating graph matching or connectivity losses, to ensure the midcurve maintains the desired topological properties.

In summary, rather than using a Seq2Seq model, a graph-to-graph architecture—combining a GNN encoder with a graph generative decoder (or translation model)—is a promising approach for your midcurve computation problem. This aligns well with recent research in molecular graph generation and other areas where graph-structured data is common.

## More details

Yes—while there isn’t yet a “plug-and-play” graph2graph model as standardized as seq2seq or image2image networks, there is a growing body of work that you can draw on to build an encoder–decoder that works directly with graphs. In essence, you can design a graph2graph translation model by combining:

1. **Graph Encoders:**  
   Use graph neural network (GNN) architectures (e.g., Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), or Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs)) to encode your input graph (the 2D shape) into a latent representation. These networks naturally handle the permutation invariance and variable sizes inherent in graph data.

2. **Graph Decoders/Generators:**  
   The decoder must generate a graph (your 1D midcurve) from the latent code. Unlike sequences, graphs have no natural ordering, so decoder design is more challenging. Several strategies exist:
   - **Autoregressive Generation:** Predict nodes and edges sequentially, similar to how one might generate molecules in chemical optimization tasks.
   - **Set-Based or Simultaneous Prediction:** Predict all nodes (or a mask over nodes) and then predict edges among them.
   - **Variational Approaches:** Conditional Variational Graph Autoencoders (CVGAEs) have been explored for conditional graph generation. Although “autoencoder” in the name, you can modify these frameworks to handle different input–output pairs (i.e., conditional generation rather than pure reconstruction).

3. **Graph Pooling/Unpooling (Graph U-Nets):**  
   In tasks like midcurve extraction, where you want to reduce dimensionality (i.e., “squeeze” a 2D profile into a 1D curve), ideas from Graph U-Nets may help. They incorporate pooling (to downsample) and unpooling (to upsample) operations on graphs while respecting the graph structure.

### Far more details

Let's break down the ideas step by step and see how they can be implemented in a practical architecture for the midcurve computation problem. In summary, these approaches are feasible, but they require careful design to handle variable graph sizes, maintain geometric validity, and capture the underlying structure. Here’s a detailed plan:

---

### 1. **GNNs as Encoders**

**Feasibility:**  
Using a GNN encoder is highly feasible since graphs are naturally permutation-invariant and can handle variable input sizes without needing fixed-length padding.

**How to Implement:**  
- **Input Representation:**  
  Each profile (e.g., the closed polygon) is represented as a graph with nodes (points with 2D coordinates) and edges (connectivity information). Additional features (e.g., normals, curvature) could be included if available.

- **Architecture:**  
  - **Layer Stack:** Use several layers of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), or Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) to aggregate local and global information.
  - **Pooling/Readout:** To obtain a latent code representing the entire shape, include a global pooling layer (mean, max, or attention-based pooling) that aggregates per-node features into a fixed-dimensional vector.
  - **Output:** This latent representation \( z \) will encapsulate the profile's geometry and topology and will be fed into the decoder.

---

### 2. **Graph Decoders / Generative Models**

**Feasibility:**  
Generating a graph from a latent code is challenging but feasible with current graph generative models. The output graph (the midcurve) is generally smaller and has its own connectivity, which can be modeled explicitly.

**How to Implement:**  
- **Autoregressive Graph Generation (GraphRNN):**  
  - **Sequential Generation:** Generate nodes and edges one at a time. At each step, the model predicts the next node’s coordinates and its connections to previously generated nodes.
  - **Variable Length:** The process continues until a termination condition is met (e.g., a special token or reaching a predicted maximum length).

- **Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE):**  
  - **Latent Sampling:** Use the latent code \( z \) from the encoder as a prior. The decoder samples from this latent space and reconstructs both node positions and the adjacency matrix.
  - **Losses:** Besides reconstruction loss, include a KL divergence term to regularize the latent space.

- **Conditional Graph Generative Models:**  
  - **Conditioning on \( z \):** Use conditional GANs or VAEs that take the encoder’s latent code as a condition. This approach can be used to generate output graphs that adhere to specific structural constraints learned from data.

**Decoder Tasks:**  
- **Node Prediction:** Predict the coordinates of each node.
- **Edge Prediction:** Predict the connectivity (which nodes are connected) – typically a classification task (edge exists or not).

---

### 3. **Graph-to-Graph Translation Architectures**

**Feasibility:**  
Yes, this is a natural extension where the problem is framed as “translating” an input graph (profile) into an output graph (midcurve).

**How to Implement:**  
- **Encoder-Decoder Pipeline:**  
  - **Encoder:** As described above (GNN encoder that produces a latent code \( z \)).
  - **Decoder:** A graph decoder that takes \( z \) and sequentially or in parallel generates the midcurve graph.
  
- **End-to-End Training:**  
  Train the encoder and decoder jointly on paired data (profile graph, midcurve graph) using a loss function that accounts for both node positions and edge connectivity.

---

### 4. **Attention-Based Graph Models (Graph Transformers)**

**Feasibility:**  
Graph transformers are emerging as powerful tools for capturing long-range dependencies in graphs and can be applied both in the encoder and decoder.

**How to Implement:**  
- **Architecture:**  
  - **Self-Attention Mechanisms:** Use self-attention layers that operate on node embeddings. This is beneficial for complex shapes where relationships are non-local.
  - **Positional Encodings:** Since graphs lack a natural order, include learned or relative positional encodings to help the model understand structure.
  
- **Integration:**  
  They can either replace or augment traditional GNN layers in both the encoder and decoder.

---

### **Loss Formulation**

**Key Components:**

1. **Node Coordinate Reconstruction Loss:**  
   - Use an L2 (mean squared error) loss between predicted node coordinates and ground truth coordinates.
   
2. **Edge Connectivity Loss:**  
   - Apply a binary cross-entropy loss (or similar) on the predicted edge probabilities versus the ground truth adjacency matrix.
   - *Graph Matching:* Because nodes may not have a fixed order, you might incorporate a graph matching loss (using, for instance, the Hungarian algorithm) to correctly associate predicted nodes with their ground truth counterparts.

3. **Latent Space Regularization (if using VAE):**  
   - Include a KL divergence loss to regularize the latent code distribution.
   
4. **Global Structural Loss (Optional):**  
   - Consider additional losses that enforce global properties like connectivity, smoothness, or centrality of the midcurve relative to the profile.

---

### **Decoding for Unseen Shapes**

**How to Decode:**

1. **Latent Extraction:**  
   - For an unseen profile, first pass it through the GNN encoder to extract the latent representation \( z \).

2. **Graph Generation:**  
   - Feed \( z \) into the graph decoder. If using an autoregressive model (e.g., GraphRNN), the decoder sequentially generates nodes and edges until a termination condition is met.
   - For models that generate the entire graph in one shot (e.g., conditional VGAEs), the output is directly the predicted midcurve graph.

3. **Post-Processing:**  
   - Optionally, apply geometric post-processing to ensure the midcurve is topologically valid and smooth. This might include enforcing connectivity rules or slight adjustments to node positions.

4. **Beam Search (for Autoregressive Models):**  
   - Use beam search or similar decoding strategies to explore multiple generation paths and select the one that best matches expected geometric criteria.

---

### **Summary**

- **Feasibility:**  
  All the outlined ideas are feasible with current deep learning techniques. The key is to select the components (encoder, decoder, loss functions) that best capture the structure and geometry of your data.

- **Architecture:**  
  A typical architecture could be:
  - **Encoder:** GNN (or Graph Transformer) layers with global pooling.
  - **Latent Representation:** A fixed-dimensional code summarizing the input profile.
  - **Decoder:**  
    - **Option 1:** Autoregressive GraphRNN that sequentially generates nodes and edges.
    - **Option 2:** Conditional VGAE or GAN that generates the output graph in one shot.
  
- **Loss Formulation:**  
  Combine node coordinate reconstruction (L2 loss), edge connectivity (binary cross-entropy), potential graph matching loss for permutation invariance, and (if applicable) latent space regularization (KL divergence).

- **Decoding Unseen Shapes:**  
  Leverage the trained encoder-decoder pipeline where the encoder extracts a latent representation from an unseen profile and the decoder generates the corresponding midcurve graph. Use beam search or additional post-processing to ensure geometric consistency.

By carefully integrating these components and ensuring the loss functions capture both local and global structure, you can build a robust graph-to-graph translation model for midcurve computation.

### Relevant Work and Ideas

- **Graph-to-Sequence vs. Graph-to-Graph:**  
  While there are a number of works on *graph-to-sequence* models (e.g., for program synthesis or code generation), the graph-to-graph translation setting is emerging. Some works in molecule optimization (e.g., generating a modified molecular graph from an input molecule) follow similar ideas. For instance, methods that generate new molecular graphs by first encoding an input molecule and then decoding a modified version can be seen as graph2graph translation.

- **Generative Models for Graphs:**  
  Papers like *GraphVAE* and surveys on deep generative models for graphs (e.g., “Deep Generative Models of Graphs: A Comprehensive Survey”) provide insight into how to design decoders that can output graphs. Although many of these models are unsupervised (i.e., autoencoders), the ideas can be adapted to conditional generation when paired graphs are available.

- **Frameworks and Libraries:**  
  Libraries such as [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/) and [Deep Graph Library (DGL)](https://www.dgl.ai/) offer building blocks (graph convolution layers, pooling/unpooling modules, etc.) that you can use to construct a custom graph2graph architecture.

### Putting It Together for Your Midcurve Problem

For your specific application (midcurve generation):

- **Encoder:**  
  Use a GNN (GCN, GAT, or MPNN) to process the input polygon (2D shape), aggregating information from neighboring nodes (vertices) and edges (curves). The network would produce latent node embeddings or a global latent vector.

- **Decoder:**  
  Design a decoder that “generates” the midcurve. This might involve:
  - Predicting a binary mask over the nodes of the input graph that indicates which nodes belong to the midcurve.
  - Alternatively, if the output midcurve has a different graph structure, you might use an autoregressive decoder to generate the nodes and edges of the midcurve sequentially.
  - Consider using graph deconvolution or unpooling layers if the midcurve is represented as a downsampled version of the original graph.

- **Training Supervision:**  
  Since you have paired input–output graphs, you can use supervised learning to minimize a loss defined over the differences between the predicted and ground-truth graphs. This might combine node-level losses (e.g., classification or regression on node features) and edge-level losses (e.g., predicting connectivity).

### Summary

While there isn’t a “one-size-fits-all” graph2graph model analogous to seq2seq, you can build one by:
- **Encoding the input graph** with a GNN,
- **Mapping to a latent representation**, and then
- **Decoding that representation** into the output graph using a graph generative model (which might be autoregressive, variational, or based on graph pooling/unpooling).

Exploring recent literature in conditional graph generation, graph autoencoders (modified for conditional tasks), and applications in molecular graph optimization can provide useful ideas and architectural choices.

In short, yes—graph2graph models exist in research, and while you may need to design a custom architecture for your problem, there’s a solid foundation of methods and tools you can leverage to build an encoder–decoder network that directly maps graphs to graphs.
