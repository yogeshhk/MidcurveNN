## Prompt

```
You are an expert in Geometric Modeling algorithms as well as Artificial Intelligence. You are working on a problem called 'Midcurve Computation' and exploring which approaches are possible.

'Midcurve Computation' is essentially a dimension reduction problem on shapes. Graph Summarization/Dimension-Reduction/Compression: Reducing a large graph to a smaller graph preserving its underlying structure, similar to text summarization, which attempts to keep the essence.

Here,

- Input is 2D profile, say a closed polygon. Example: thick ‘L’ profile.
- Output is 1D curve in the middle of the profile.
- 2D shapes are represented as graph, where vertices as nodes, connecting curves as edges.

Wish to build encoder-decoder network which accepts graphs as input as well as output.
Training set of such input and output graphs pairs is available for any supervised approach.

Main considerations:

- The limitation with Seq2Seq models is notable; the input polygons and output branched midcurves are not linearly connected. They may exhibit loops or branches, necessitating further consideration for a more suitable solution.
- It poses a variable input and variable output challenge, given that the number of points and lines differs in the input and output.
- For Encoder-Decoder networks like those in Tensorflow, fixed-length inputs are necessary. Introducing variable lengths poses a significant hurdle as padding with a distinct unused value, such as 0,0, is not feasible, considering it could represent a valid point.

Similar to Seq2Seq models, are there graph2graph models available suitable for above problem? Any ideas?

## Response

Yes, there are graph-to-graph models suitable for your midcurve computation problem, which can be framed as a graph summarization/dimension reduction task. Given the challenges you've outlined, particularly the non-linear structure of the input and output, and the variable input/output size, here's a breakdown of potential approaches and considerations:

**1. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Encoding and Decoding**

* **GNNs for Feature Extraction:** Utilize GNNs to encode the 2D polygonal shape into a latent representation. GNNs are well-suited for capturing geometric features and relationships between nodes (vertices) and edges (connecting curves)[^2]. Different GNN architectures can be explored, such as:
    * **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)**: Effective for propagating information between neighboring nodes.
    * **Graph Attention Networks (GATs)**: Employ attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different neighbors[^3].
    * **Topology Adaptive Graph Convolution (TAGConv)**: Uses adaptive, fixed-size filters for graph convolutions, ensuring more accurate geometric representations[^2].
* **Encoder-Decoder Framework:** Frame the problem within an encoder-decoder architecture[^4]. The encoder GNN maps the input graph to a latent space, and a decoder GNN reconstructs the midcurve graph from this latent representation.
* **Variable Input Sizes:** GNNs are inherently capable of handling variable input sizes, making them suitable for your problem[^5].
* **Physics Encoding:** Consider encoding physical information, such as forces or material properties, into the graph nodes to improve deformation prediction and mid-curve generation[^2].

**2. Mid-Curve Extraction with Neural Networks**

* **Image Completion Neural Network:** One approach involves using a medial axis transform (MAT) to generate an initial skeleton of the 2D shape. Then, train an image completion neural network to fill in masked regions corresponding to connections and end regions of the medial axis[^1].
* **Hybrid Approach:** Combine the MAT, which produces correct mid-curves in thin regions, with the neural network's ability to learn connection models and complete masked regions[^1].
* **Contour Finding Algorithms:** Use contour finding algorithms (e.g., marching squares from scikit-image) to extract geometric entities from the completed image and generate a geometrical mid-curve model[^1].

**3. Graph Output Attribution (GOAt) for Explainability**

* **Interpretability:** Use techniques like Graph Output Attribution (GOAt) to understand how the GNN arrives at its prediction[^3]. GOAt helps attribute graph outputs to input graph features, providing insights into the GNN's decision-making process[^3].

**4. Addressing Non-Linearity and Branched Structures**

* **Dataset Generation:** Create a diverse training dataset that includes various polygon shapes and their corresponding midcurves, including those with loops and branches[^1].
* **Loss Function:** Design a loss function that encourages the decoder to produce accurate midcurves, considering both geometric fidelity and connectivity.

**5. Addressing Fixed-Length Input Requirements**

* **Attention Mechanisms:** Employ attention mechanisms in the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the encoded graph when generating the output midcurve[^4]. This reduces the need for fixed-length inputs.
* **Graph Embeddings:** Represent the input graph as a fixed-size embedding vector using techniques like graph kernels or graph neural networks. This embedding can then be used as input to a standard decoder.

By combining GNNs with encoder-decoder architectures and addressing the specific challenges of midcurve computation, you can develop a robust and accurate graph-to-graph model for your problem.
