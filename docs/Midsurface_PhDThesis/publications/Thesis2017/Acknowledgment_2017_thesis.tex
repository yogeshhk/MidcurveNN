Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisors Dr. Anil Sahasrabudhe and Dr. Mukund Kale for their guidance and continuous support during my Ph.D research and at the time of writing of this thesis. I could not have imagined having better advisors for this journey.

I would also like to thank the rest of my thesis committee: Prof. Vipin Tripathi, Prof. Arati Mulay, and Dr. S. N. Sapali, for their encouragement.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank my family: my parents, my wife - Anjali, and my kids - Reeya \& Deeya, for supporting me in this endeavor.
