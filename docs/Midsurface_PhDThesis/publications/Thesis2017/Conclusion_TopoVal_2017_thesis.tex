\section{Conclusions}
This chapter presented the approach of topological validation of midsurface, computed from sheet metal part model. It has two phases. In the first phase, called ``solid to surface'', given the topological entities of the input solid, its midsurface entities are predicted. In the second, called ``surface to solid'', given the topological entities of midsurface, the topological entities of its corresponding input solid are predicted. Any mismatch between predicted entities and the actual ones, suggests error, which needs to be located and fixed. Shape with or without draft angle are topologically the same, so the formulation developed here applies to them equivalently.

The proposed approach scores over the past topological validation approaches in the fact that it is purely topologically based and does not use any geometrical entities. It is not heuristic in nature and is less error prone.  the topological validation method elaborated here should be used in conjunction with the existing geometric validation method, for completeness.  The examples demonstrated show efficacy of the proposed approach not only for simple academic models but also for the real-life sheet metal part models.
