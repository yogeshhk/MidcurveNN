\section{Conclusion}

%Simplification by removing the irrelevant data, decomposition to reduce complexity of the domain, and abstraction/generalization to devise a generic logic, have been core themes of this work to compute a well-connected midsurface.

Computation of midsurface is one of the popular simplification techniques for CAE analysis of  thin-walled models. Study of the existing techniques revealed critical insights into the problems of the  midsurface results (gaps, overlaps, lack of isomorphism, etc.), such as failures in the face-pair detection and interactions. Interactions were studied to conclude that the cellular decomposition can be used to develop a uniform logic for joining the midsurface patches.

In the proposed approach, a feature-based  CAD model of thin-walled solid is simplified first by defeaturing techniques to result into ``gross shape'' which is found to reduces failures in the  downstream process. Then remaining features are converted to their equivalent generic form of Sweep/Loft.  Model is decomposed so that computing midsurface patches from each sub-volume, as well as connecting them becomes far easier.  %Thus, the proposed methodology scores over existing approaches not only in terms of simplifying the complexities to a great extent, but also being applicable over a wide variety of geometries and connection types. 
Although individual functionalities such as defeaturing, abstraction, decomposition processes may show certain shortcomings, but overall, the proposed approach seems to work well and is able to compute a well-connected midsurface in robust, definitive and generic manner, with minimal failures.  Following is a  comparative analysis of some relevant approaches vis-a-vis our approach:
