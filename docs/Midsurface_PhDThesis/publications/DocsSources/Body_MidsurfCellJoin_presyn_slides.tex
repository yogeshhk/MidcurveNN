\begin{frame}{Face Pairs Detection Problem}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,label=\textbullet,topsep=2pt,parsep=2pt,partopsep=2pt]
\item Face pairs, in a way, decompose the whole shape into sub-volumes. 
\item Each sub-volume, creates its own midsurface patch. 
\item The main challenge in using the features is their variety.
\item Convert to $\mathcal{ABLE}$: ``Sweep'' with a profile and  a guide curve.
\item Sweeping the profile upto half of the guide curve, or 
\item By sweeping the midcurve of the profile by a full guide curve. 
\item Using this, the necessity of detecting face pairs can be avoided.

\begin{frame}{Face Pair Interaction Problem}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,label=\textbullet,topsep=2pt,parsep=2pt,partopsep=2pt]
\item Critical to ``joining'' is to know how the features interact. 
\item No framework for all interaction types, so, no unified logic \cite{Stolt2006}.
\item A large variety is possible, as Aligned, L, T, Overlap and Crossing.

\item Clear that the numbers of interactions are too many. 
\item Developing logic for each of these cases can be a tedious task. 
\item Desirable to provide a uniform logic that can take care of all or most of the cases. 
\item All-encompassing scheme is possible with cellular representation.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,label=\textbullet,topsep=2pt,parsep=2pt,partopsep=2pt]
\item Input is a feature-based design (fbd) CAD model 
\item Fbd is decomposed into cells-bodies, with the assigned feature owners. Cell-bodies do not overlap volumetrically, but may overlap at faces, fully.
\item An adjacency-graph is formed with the nodes ($n$) representing the cell-bodies. For each such face-overlap, a corresponding edge ($e$) is created in the graph. An edge $E$ has two $n$s attached on either end.  
\item Cells are classified into solid cells ($sCell$) and interface cells ($iCell$).  The commonly shared cells are marked as interface cells ($iCell$) and the others as solid cells ($sCell$)

\item As the owner feature is represented by ``Sweep/Loft'', extract the profile $p$) and guide curve ($g$).
\item The profile $p$ is considered thin if it's size far less than the size of the guide curve $g$.  Threshold value based on the experimentation is used.
	\item If the profile $p$ is thin: A midcurve ($m^1$) is computed from $p$, $m^1$ is swept using guide curve $g$ to generated midsurface patch $m^2$.
	\item If the profile $p$ is thick: $p$ is offset by half of $g$ so as to lie midway.

\item If the ``other node'' is $sCell$, Extend  up to $iCell$'s centroid
\item  If the ``other node'' is a $iCell$, an extra patch is needed between the centroids of the two $iCell$s.
