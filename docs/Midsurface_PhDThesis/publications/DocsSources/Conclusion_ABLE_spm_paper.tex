\section{Conclusion}
This paper proposes a novel way of abstracting {\em form features} and then representing them using Spatial Grammar notations, called {\bf $\mathcal{ABLE}$}, which uses just few operators, like {\em Loft}({\bf $\mathcal{L}$}), {\em Booleans}({\bf $\mathcal{B}$}) and {\em Affine Transformations}({\bf $\mathcal{A}$}). {\bf $\mathcal{ABLE}$} will help not only in interoperability but also in developing portable application specific algorithms, as demonstrated by developing a Midsurface operator used in CAE analysis. 

An approach of Generic Programming for feature based algorithms has been investigated. With this it is possible to develop algorithms and derived data structures which are independent of the underlying feature model, an idea which is crucial for implementing the concepts presented before in a truly reusable and general way.

Future work consists of implementation of the framework for computing Midsurface as well as bringing more features, especially Free-form-features under {\bf $\mathcal{ABLE}$} scheme.
