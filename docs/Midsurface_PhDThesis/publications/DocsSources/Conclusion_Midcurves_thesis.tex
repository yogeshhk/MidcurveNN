%\section{Conclusion}

Midcurve computed by methods like MAT, CAT, Straight Skeleton, etc. typically does not represent the shape as per human perception, due to presence of gaps and unnecessary branches.  The proposed approach tests the hypothesis (Hypothesis \ref{hyp:midcurve}) that instead of computing midcurve of the whole shape in one go, one can divide the shape in more manageable, simpler shapes, for which midcurve generation is a way simpler problem. The results of improved partitioning (over Bayazit's \cite{Bayazit} approach) and its usage in creating properly connected midcurve are shown.
