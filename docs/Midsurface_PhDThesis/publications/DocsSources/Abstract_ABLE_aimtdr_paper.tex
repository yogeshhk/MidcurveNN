Shapes modeled using Computer Aided Design (CAD) applications are used in downstream applications like, manufacturing (Computer Aided Manufacturing, CAM), Analysis (Computer Aided Engineering, CAE) etc. Use of form features is prevalent in the CAD applications, but their leveraging in the downstream applications is not very common especially in the CAE applications.

The initial phase of design demands for quick analysis of the model. Here, CAD models are often simplified by removing the irrelevant features (de-featuring) and idealizing solids to surfaces or curves (dimension reduction), so that the CAE analysis gets performed with lesser resources and time. Midsurface Extraction is one of the ways of dimension reduction where thin-walled portions of a solid are idealized to surfaces lying midway.

This paper presents a novel representation scheme (called ABLE) for CAD entities and operators including form features which is then leveraged to define the algorithm for extracting Midsurface
