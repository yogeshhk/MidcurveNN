Computer Aided Design (CAD) applications are widely used in industrial product development. Feature-based Design (Design-by-Features) is the paradigm followed by most of the CAD applications. Due to variety in definition of features and their usage, interoperability between CAD applications is not seamless.This paper proposes a novel Feature abstraction scheme using spatial grammar notation which will help represent widely used features in an abstract-generic manner.

Functionalities in the downstream applications like manufacturing (Computer Aided Manufacturing, CAM), Analysis (Computer Aided Engineering, CAE) etc. are tightly coupled with the input CAD data model. Due to differences in Feature schema of different CAD applications, algorithms for downstream applications like CAE can not be developed in an abstract-portable manner. This paper proposes use of Generic Programming to represent Midsurface algorithm (as a test case) based on Feature abstraction developed before.
